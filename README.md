<h1>Flowers Detection with Transfer Learning</h1>

<p>This project is with the same concept as the previous project <b>Transfer Learning</b>. I have downloaded the data from <b>TensorFlow Datasets</b> and imported the ImageNet pre-trained model. Also, considered another concept <b>Model Freezing</b>, which would freeze the feature extractors, in order to change the classifier model only.</p>
